## ðŸ§­ Overview

**TWIN4DEM** (*Digital Twins for Democracy*) is a Horizon Europe-funded project that aims to explore how digital technologiesâ€”particularly digital twinsâ€”can help protect democratic values and institutions.

The project develops a novel conceptual and computational framework to:
- Detect signs of **executive aggrandisement** in democratic systems
- Understand **citizens' and institutional responses** to threats to democracy
- Propose **policy pathways and mitigation tools** based on participatory and inclusive digital models

TWIN4DEM brings together researchers from political science, computational social science, AI, law, and philosophy to co-create digital solutions for more resilient democracies. This GitHub organization serves as the **open science hub** of the project, where code, data, and documentation will be shared publicly.
